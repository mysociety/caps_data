        <h2>Climate Emergency Action Plan Consultation</h2>
<p class="date">From: 31/05/2021 To: 30/07/2021.</p>        <div class="editor">
<p>The Council has adopted the <a href="https://www.harborough.gov.uk/info/20047/climate_emergency/458/climate_emergency_action_plan">Climate Emergency Action Plan</a> and agreed that it should form part of the <a href="https://www.harborough.gov.uk/directory_record/472/corporate_plan">Council&#39;s Corporate Plan 2022-31</a>.</p>

<p>As part of our consultation we held a successful online workshop attended by climate focus groups, student representation and eco-groups from across the Harborough district. We have also received more than 130 responses to the online survey.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support. Please follow #ClimateActionHarborough on social media channels for updates and related news.</p>

<h2>Summary of consultation and next steps</h2>

<p><strong>What we asked people to consult with us about</strong><br aria-hidden="true" />
The Council declared a Climate Emergency in June 2019 and we committed to producing an action plan. We consulted our communities on whether our plan was addressing the right actions to address the Climate Emergency.</p>

<p><strong>When / how we asked people to be involved</strong><br aria-hidden="true" />
We asked people to respond to us via an online survey, which was available on our website, but we also accepted emailed responses from groups. We promoted the consultation in our newsletters, online, on social media and via libraries and community networks, including contacting all secondary schools.</p>

<p><strong>What we learned from the responses</strong><br aria-hidden="true" />
We learnt that people agreed with our commitments, but called on us to be bold in our actions to address climate change, including through partnerships and community empowerment</p>

<p><strong>What the next steps are / resulting actions are for HDC and timings for these</strong><br aria-hidden="true" />
Council received the post consultation Action Plan at their meeting in December 2021 and decided to adopt it. The Plan now forms part of the Corporate Plan and will be regularly monitored by Cabinet. A report on progress will be published in early autumn 2022.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Council commits to demonstrate political and corporate leadership to act on climate change.</h2>

<p>The Council is in an excellent place to provide leadership in responding to the climate emergency and work with partners to promote positive change.</p>

<p>What we have done so far:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Promoted action on Climate Change through Climate Local from 2013/14, including annual reports on action</li>
	<li>Public Electric Vehicle charging has been delivered in Market Harborough, Lutterworth, Broughton Astley and Kibworth</li>
	<li>Promoted and supported the Plastic Free pledge with local community groups</li>
</ul>

<p>What we hope to do:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Seek funding for further electric vehicle charging infrastructure</li>
	<li>Include training in climate emergency for all staff and members</li>
	<li>Work with Parishes and communities to promote lower carbon choices</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Council commits to managing its own assets and services, with the aim of reducing carbon emission to net zero by 2030, as far as practical.</h2>

<p>The Council has made good progress in reducing it&rsquo;s own emissions, but there is always more to do and it will be difficult for the council to move away from using gas fuel.</p>

<p>What we have done so far:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Harborough District Council has reduced their own emissions by over 40% since 2008.</li>
	<li>Carbon emissions from Leisure and Waste services have reduced by over 400 tonnes</li>
	<li>New buildings such as the Harborough Grow-on Centre (HGC) have been delivered to BREEAM excellent standard</li>
	<li>Moved to a renewable electricity supplier</li>
</ul>

<p>What we hope to do:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Review procurement procedures to ensure low carbon is included in relevant decisions</li>
	<li>Ensure any new council building projects are low carbon and delivered to high environmental standards</li>
	<li>New projects will include whole life costings for consideration</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Council commits to working with residents and communities to support their actions in reducing emissions and help them increase their resilience to the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The Council is well placed to work with residents and the work on energy efficiency has shown a real reduction in fuel poverty across the district from 11.5% in 2011 to 6.9% in 2017.</p>

<p>What we have done so far:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Promoted the availability of ECO-grants to improve domestic energy efficiency with over 500 homes receiving help in 2018/19</li>
	<li>Promoted a regular Switch and Save, community auction project, to help residents reduce costs of electricity and gas and move to a renewable, sustainable household energy provider.</li>

<h2>The Council commits to ensuring that new development is designed to mitigate emissions and be resilient to the impact of climate change.&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The Council have recognised the issue of Climate Change in the New Local Plan 2011 to 2031 and will promote lower carbon emissions in new development through promoting best practice. The Local Plan also identifies that mitigations will be needed as we feel the impact of climate change.</p>

<h2>The Council commits to working in partnership to promote resilient natural systems that will help to reduce the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We realise we are not able to avoid all the changes that Climate Change will cause. It is important to ensure that natural systems can be used to increase the resilience to flooding and that biodiversity is promoted. Tree planting and sensitive land-use will also help to offset climate emissions.</p>

<ul>

	<li>Identify critical spaces for biodiversity improvements</li>
	<li>Develop guidance for developers</li>
	<li>Promote Natural Flood Management projects in catchment areas</li>
