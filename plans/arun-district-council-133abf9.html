<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The council declared a climate emergency in January 2020 and stated its aim to be carbon neutral by 2030, twenty years ahead of the current UK government target. To analyse the council&rsquo;s carbon emission a detailed carbon audit was carried out in 2021. This analysis is outlined in the council&rsquo;s Carbon Neutral Strategy (2022-30) which was adopted in October 2021.</p>
<p>The carbon audit provided a baseline to measure future carbon reductions and savings. This Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan has been produced to sit alongside the Carbon Neutral Strategy and provide a schedule of all the projects and plans which must be undertaken in the coming months and years to reduce the emissions generated by the council in order to achieve the 2030 target.</p>
<p>This work plan is also aligned to the Council Vision 2022-2026 which has a key aim of &lsquo;Supporting the environment&rsquo;, improving sustainability, biodiversity and protecting habitats.</p>
<h4>Emission Baselines</h4>
<p>The council commissioned a carbon audit to calculate its carbon emissions and to set baselines. The audit used data from the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21.</p>
<p>This allowed for comparison of emissions pre-pandemic and during the restrictions to assess any incomplete or missing data from either year. The carbon emissions were categorised as Scope 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.</p>

<p>The Carbon Reduction Strategy identified 3 priority areas that will be addressed to ensure that there are reductions across all scopes.</p>
<p>Priority 1 Supply Chain</p>
<p>Priority 2 Energy</p>
<p>Priority 3 Other emitters</p>
<p>The largest single emitter was the council&rsquo;s supply chain (86.88% of total emissions), therefore working closely with suppliers and contractors will be essential in ensuring that the 2030 target is reached.</p>
<p>It will also be important to reduce energy demands and usage in all corporate buildings, reduce non-electric vehicle usage and car mileage, whilst increasing the amount of renewable energy generated and ensuring that biodiversity within the district is enhanced and protected.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the diagram below (Figure 1), emissions generated from the council&rsquo;s housing stock and the waste produced by residents and businesses were excluded from the core carbon footprint of the council.</p>
<p>This was due to these emissions not being within the direct control of the council, however it should be noted that improving the fabric of council housing stock and the efficiency of heating and lighting systems are included in this Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan.</p>
<p><img alt="Fig 1" src="/media/images/versions/img94joktmu719844.jpg?bev=18558" /></p>
<p>Fig 1.&nbsp;Graphic to showcase which emission sources have been included within the council&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>
<h3>Business as usual</h3>
<p>Figure 2 (below) indicates how the council&rsquo;s emissions will change if a business-as-usual approach is adopted, with only a 3.5% year on year reduction included to show the impact of the predicted economic decarbonation. As can be seen from the emission levels a significant amount of additional work is required for the council to reach its 2030 target.</p>

<p>Fig 2. Graphic showing how a &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; approach will result in the council failing to reach its 2030 target</p>
<h3>Carbon reduction to 2030 taking the actions identified in the work plan</h3>
<p>The graph below (Figure 3) shows a course which will allow the council to reach its 2030 target, also taking into consideration predicted offsetting figures provided by tree planting and current renewable electricity generation via the PV installed on the Civic Centre. As expected, there will need to be reductions across all three scopes with a significant focus on Scope 3, as this makes up the majority of the council&rsquo;s total emissions. Figure 3 reflects the 2020-2021 baseline year, allowing for targets to be set from 2022-2023 onwards.</p>
<p><img alt="Fig 3" src="/media/images/versions/img94joktmu719846.png?bev=18560" /></p>
<p>Fig 3. Graphic showing that by reducing emissions from all 3 Scopes the council will reach its 2030 target</p>
<p>Figure 4 indicates projected emission reductions over the next few years. These will be achieved by increasing year-on-year reductions in emissions associated with the council&rsquo;s supply chain, transitioning all council used vehicles to EV in 2022, where possible, and limiting the emissions associated with business travel, employee commute, water/waste usage and fuel/energy usage outside of Scope 1 and 2. The council will also be working closely with Freedom Leisure which is actively addressing its energy consumption and emissions.</p>

<p>This Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan is a document that will record the progress of projects that have been identified and evolve to incorporate innovation in the field of carbon reduction and management. This document highlights the work that the council will need to undertake and the challenges it will need to overcome. The Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan will also help the council identify priorities to reduce emissions and help support us to develop policies to reduce emissions across the district.</p>
<p>The council is committed to achieving its 2030 target and this document is designed to help plan projects and monitor the results. However, there are limitations to what we can achieve on our own and we will need to help others work towards carbon neutral goals of their own.</p>
