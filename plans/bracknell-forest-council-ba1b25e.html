      <h5>Description</h5>

<p>Enforcement on idling vehicle engines within the borough.</p>

<h5>Lead officers</h5>

<p>Jason Webb and Councillor Harrison.</p>

<h5>Measures linked to monitoring progress</h5>

<p>Recorded number of incidences.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2021</h5>

<p>Successfully ran a schools' competition to design an anti-idling sticker for residents to place in their rear windscreens.</p>

<p>Winning design to be chosen and made available in quarter 4.</p>

<p>Will be commissioning a behaviour change specialist in Spring 2022 to design anti-idling posters for use in areas where enforcement action can be undertaken.</p>

<h5>Quarter 4 update - January to March 2022</h5>

<p>The Anti-Idling Bumper Sticker competition was successful. Stickers are now being produced.</p>

<p>The Public Protection Partnership has commissioned a behaviour change specialist who will be making promotional material to target taxis drivers.</p>

<h5>Quarter 1 update - April to June 2022</h5>

<p>AECOM, the company providing the monitoring services, have successfully completed 7 of the first 42 reports investigating particular matter concentrations around schools. So far, the reports have identified low PM2.5 concentrations at school, falling below the AQOs and the guidance provided by WHO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Baseline Research Report is being developed to understand the presence, causes, views and options to reduce idling across the 3 boroughs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Triplicates of diffusion tubes, monitoring NO2 concentrations, have been setup at those same 42 schools included under the PM2.5 monitoring programme. The results from this monitoring will be used for the ‘NO2 Biggest Loser Competition’. This will begin later this year to encourage schools to take action to reduce concentrations around their school.</p>

<h5>Quarter 2 update - July to September 2022</h5>

<p>AECOM have successfully completed 7 of the first 42 reports investigating particulate matter concentrations at those schools closest to the 7 AQMAs throughout the PPP area (14 from each borough). The remaining 35 reports will be completed throughout the remainder of the grant funding period to March 2023. The reports received so far have all identified low PM2.5 concentrations at school, falling beneath the AQOs and guidance provided by WHO.</p>

<p>WSP have been underway conducting research to build a Baseline Research Report, investigating the:</p>

<ul><li>presence of idling</li>
	<li>causes of idling</li>

</ul><p>We are now working with WSP to produce a package of measures which aim to reduce idling, through measures like signage, toolkits, social media messaging and bumper stickers. Final designs for this package of measures are expected to be received in July ready for implementation as soon as possible.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2022</h5>

<p>PPP conducted sessions to train officers with an approach towards vehicle engine idling.</p>

<p>Officers are now equipped with leaflets and a proper process for approaching idling drivers to encourage them to switch off their engines.</p>

<p>Officers have started to collect some basic information about their interactions with idling drivers to better shape the future approach and identify any repeat offending groups or locations.</p>

<p>So far most people are resistant to change and continue to idle after being asked to switch off.</p>

<p>Final data for 2020 to 2021 was 2988,951 kWh ~ 55.4 CO2 tonnes, which represents an increase of 20%. This may be due to COVID-19 as windows were needed to be left open to allow for fresh air, subsequent result is heat loss.</p>

<p>Sandhurst secondary school have taken part in an oil to gas conversion. This started in 2021 to 2022. Average annual oil use equated to 126.9 CO2e tonnes. We are waiting for gas consumption data in order to compare this.&nbsp;</p>

      <h5>Description</h5>

<p>To seek funding for energy saving green initiatives that will reduce overall energy consumption.</p>

<h5>Lead officers</h5>

<p>Hash Patel and Kamay Toor.</p>

<h5>Measures linked to monitoring progress</h5>

<p>Reduced energy bills, reduction in GHG related to energy consumption.</p>

<h5>Baseline measure at the start of the project</h5>

<p>The council spent just over £2.1 million in 2021 to 2022 on its utility costs.</p>

<p>In quarter 1 2022 we spent&nbsp;£327,586. This is 43% up since quarter 1 2021 and the projection is that energy costs will continue to rise steeply. Costs are projected to increase by around 300% within the next 12 months.</p>

<h5>Target and measurement</h5>

<p>Aims to provide investment over a range of projects across the borough which are closely linked to the building planned maintenance annual programme.</p>

<p>Typically includes the repair or replacement of elements of building fabric, fixtures or fittings that are worn, obsolete or otherwise damaged. Will also incorporate several replacement heating systems, deploy Photo Voltaic (PV) solar cells and increase insulation to buildings.</p>

<p>These schemes will reduce energy consumption by approximately 357,966kWh (estimated 67.7 Tonnes reduction of CO²). This equates to, approximate saving of £103,400 at current energy prices (5 August 2022).</p>

<h5>Target and measurement</h5>

<p>Number of new homes meeting set criteria per year.</p>

<p>Target figure: 500 per year.</p>

<p>First 2 years of measurement (October 2018 to October 2020): 1,389.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2021</h5>

<p>Commented on 34 new mixed types of dwellings this quarter for consultation.</p>

<p>Total number of homes commented on since October 2018 start date is now 1,743. This is above the target figure of 500 per year.</p>

<h5>Quarter 4 update - January to March 2022</h5>

<p>Commented on 738 new dwellings this quarter.</p>

<p>Total number of homes commented on since October 2018 start date is now&nbsp;2,581.</p>

<h5>Quarter 1 update - April to June 2022</h5>

<p>Commented on applications involving 866 new dwellings to be built this quarter. These involve mixed types for consultation.</p>

<h5>Quarter 2 update - July to September 2022</h5>

<p>Commented on applications involving 1790 new dwellings to be built this quarter. These involve mixed types for consultation. Unfortunately, only 470 dwellings passed the CS12 policy requirements. Often they need to review the Energy Demand Assessment or it has not been included in planning application.</p>

<p>When the local plan is adopted (Spring 2023) it is hoped the council will create a ring-fenced funding pot for those developments which fail to meet the CA12 policy requirements. This will require developers to pay a compensatory sum which can be used to retrofit the borough’s least energy efficient buildings and homes and help those residents living in fuel poverty. Currently under discussion.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2022</h5>

<p>Commented on applications involving 2,688 new dwellings to be built this quarter - mixed types for consultation.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Target and measurement</h5>

<p>Target figure of 400 properties to benefit per year.</p>

<p>1,468 total in first 3 years of measurement (November 2017 to 2020).</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2021</h5>

<p>2,152 properties have benefitted from the scheme since measurement started in November 2017, up to and including 31 December 2021. This is above the target figure of 400 homes per annum.</p>

<p>2,235 properties have benefitted so far.</p>

<h5>Quarter 1 update - April to June 2022</h5>

<p>A further 49 properties have benefitted from this scheme this quarter. 36 were loft insulations and 13 cavity wall insulations.</p>

<p>The scheme has now closed, and we wait for ECO-4 due in the Autumn of 2022.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2022</h5>

<p>We have issued our Statement of Intent and have started identifying how we apply ECO-4 principles. However, the criteria are difficult to achieve and no specific works were undertaken in the quarter.</p>

<p>It is difficult to achieve high numbers due to the low-income threshold specified combined with the ECO 4 target to lift a property up a complete SAP band rating. This is particularly tough given the extensive works already achieved within the borough through previous ECO schemes. From our property database (Elmhurst) we only have 4% (2,145) households who appear to fit this criteria. Of these, almost 1,000 are park homes for whom the scheme does not apply.</p>

<h5>Quarter 2 update - July to September 2021</h5>

<p>Two EV pool cars have been ordered to replace current diesel cars.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2021</h5>

<p>We formed a bus partnership with local bus operators to produce a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="43ef8b71-d574-4f66-a5a1-cb1c039a9e92" href="/roads-parking-and-transport/travel-and-public-transport/buses" title="Buses">Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP)</a>.

<h5>Quarter 4 update - January to March 2022</h5>

<p>A series of 5 circular cycle routes have been created, using existing walking and cycling infrastructure. Maps have been produced and waymarking stickers put up on the routes themselves.</p>

<p>We took part in the&nbsp;‘Ride Anywhere Week’ - a cycle promotion event hosted on the <a href="https://www.lovetoride.net/uk">Love to Ride website</a>.</p>

<p>We established an Enhanced Bus Partnership in March with local bus operators which aims to grow back bus patronage following the COVID pandemic.</p>

<h5>Quarter 2 update - July to September 2022</h5>

<p>Staff pool cars are now fully electric.</p>

<p>Forestcare have ordered 3 electric vans for the service.</p>

<p>The decision by Forestcare to use only EVs is significant as they will be the first service to be fully using zero emission vehicles. The improvement in technology and vehicle range swayed the decision as this service have always been quite reticent to take on electric vehicles.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2022</h5>

<p>It is now standard for EVs to be considered for each vehicle “swap out”. The library home delivery service’s vehicle is next on the list to be replaced by a zero-emission vehicle.</p>

<p>The concept of independent travel training being “an offer of transport assistance” will require:</p>

<ul><li>a significant amendment to our Post 16 transport policy</li>
	<li>coproduction</li>
	<li>a public consultation</li>
	<li>the creation of a training team</li>
</ul><p>This is being costed out but will likely require £150k funding each year.&nbsp; However, in the long term this will bring significant savings as well as climate change positives.</p>

<p>Reduce the percentage of overall waste going to landfill.</p>

<h5>Lead officers</h5>

<h5>Indicators linked to monitoring progress</h5>

<p>Percentage of waste to landfill.</p>

<h5>Baseline measure at the start of the project</h5>

<p>17% (19/20 figure) NI193.</p>

<h5>Target and measurement</h5>

<p>Reduced percentage of landfill waste. 10% for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2021</h5>

<p>The landfill rate up to the end of quarter 2 was 7%.</p>

<p>The target for the year is 10% or lower and Bracknell Forest is on track to achieve this.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Quarter 4 update - January to March 2022</h5>

<p>The amount of waste collected in green bins has decreased by 25%.</p>

<h5>Quarter 1 update - April to June 2022</h5>

<p>The frequency of refuse collections alongside the food waste service has encouraged residents to maximise their recycling efforts. The amount of waste in the green refuse bins has decreased by around 25% compared to previous years. The landfill rate is 7% to the end of quarter 4, compared to 16% the previous year.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Quarter 2 update - July to September 2022</h5>

<p>For quarter 1 the landfill rate was 11.1%, this is an increase of 4% compared to the same quarter last year. However, there are fluctuations through the year so it is too soon to draw any conclusions.</p>

<p>The landfill rate is 7% to the end of quarter 3 compared to 16% the year before.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2022</h5>

<p>The landfill rate up to the end of quarter 2 was 9.9%.</p>

	<li>4,000 tonnes food waste per year</li>
</ul><h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2021</h5>

<p>To the end of quarter 2, the borough recycling rate was 58%.</p>

<p>Recycling is impacted by seasonal changes and the first 2 quarters of the year are often when the rate is at it highest. &nbsp;</p>

<h5>Quarter 4 update - January to March 2022</h5>

<p>To the end of quarter 3 the recycling rate was 57% compared to 43% a year ago.</p>

<p>1,458 tonnes of food waste was collected this quarter, reflecting the 90% of households in the borough participating in this service.</p>

<h5>Quarter 1 update - April to June 2022</h5>

<p>The end of quarter 4 found a 56% recycling rate across the full year 2021 to 2022, compared to 43.5% in 2020 to 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Quarter 2 update - July to September 2022</h5>

<p>The recycling rate for this quarter is 57.5%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recycling rate for quarter 1 is 0.9% less than the same quarter last year. The recycling rate is impacted by many external factors such as the weather and the cost of living. People are actively buying and therefore wasting less food, people buying less packaged goods can impact the amount of dry recycling as well, particularly impacting on the card tonnage which has reduced compared to a year ago.</p>

<p>Food waste recycling participation rates remain high, greater than 90%, with an average of 2.75kg collected per household, per week.</p>

<p>To end of quarter 3,080 tons of food waste was collected.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2022</h5>

<p>The recycling rate for quarter 2 is 2.2% below the same period last year. The quarter 2 recycling was impacted by reduced garden waste because of a dry summer. The kerbside collected garden waste was 2,900 tonnes this year compared to 3,400 tonnes for the previous year. Garden waste being brought into the recycling centre has also reduced to 860 tonnes this year compared to 990 tonnes last year. This is an overall lower tonnage this year.</p>

<p>As with quarter 1, the food waste recycled remains lower than last year, likely to be related to the costs of food increasing.</p>

<p>This quarter, there has been a 55.5% recycling rate.</p>

<h5>Lead officers</h5>

<p>Kilograms of waste per household per year.</p>

<h5>Baseline measure at the start of the project</h5>

<p>974kgs waste per household (2019 to 2020 figure).</p>

<h5>Target and measurement</h5>

<p>Reduce below 974kgs waste per household per year.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2021</h5>

<p>To the end of quarter 2, the waste per household across the borough was 494kg.</p>

<p>This is 3kg per property less than at end of quarter 2 in 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h5>Quarter 4 update - January to March 2022</h5>

<p>To the end of quarter 3 the waste per household across the borough was 717kg.</p>

<p>This is 64kg per property less than 2020.</p>

<h5>Quarter 1 update - April to June 2022</h5>

<p>The end of quarter 4 found the waste per household across the borough to be 933kg. This is 56kg less per property than it was in the same time period in 2020 to 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Quarter 2 update - July to September 2022</h5>

<p>This quarter compared to same quarter last financial year there has been a small decrease in overall household waste. It is early days though and the waste per household can be affected seasonally as the year progresses.</p>

<p>The cost of living will have an impact on the amount of waste being produced as this year goes on.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update - October to December 2022</h5>

<p>24,100 tonnes of waste has been produced up until the end of quarter 2 this year. This is down by 1,600 tonnes compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>This reduction is influenced by a range of things. In particular, finances will have an impact on how much people are buying and so how much they are throwing away. This drop will be related to the cost of living as well as the very dry summer causing less garden waste. In total, household waste has decreased by 6%.</p>

<h5>Quarter 3 update&nbsp;(October to December 2021)</h5>

<p>Figures for 2021 to 2022 will not be available until quarter 1 next year.</p>

<h5>Quarter 1 update (April to June 2022)</h5>

<p>In 2021 to 2022, the waste service experienced significant change which resulted in more vehicles on the road, hence an increase in total vehicle emissions. However, the food waste trucks are more fuel efficient. Their overall impact on the fleet is a reduction of average kg of CO2 emitted, by 0.98kg per mile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the year the average CO2 emitted pre mile was 2.69kg down from 2.94kg the previous year.</p>
