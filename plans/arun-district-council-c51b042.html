<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The council declared a climate emergency in January 2020 and stated its aim to be carbon neutral by 2030, twenty years ahead of the current UK government target. To analyse the council&rsquo;s carbon emission and to set a baseline, a detailed carbon audit was carried out in 2021. This analysis is outlined in the council&rsquo;s Carbon Neutral Strategy (2022-30) which was adopted in October 2021. The monitoring of emissions will be essential in tracking the council&rsquo;s journey to carbon neutrality &ndash; therefore a detailed emission audit will be carried out each financial year.</p>
<p>The carbon audit provided a baseline to measure future carbon reductions and savings. This Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan has been produced to sit alongside the Carbon Neutral Strategy. It provides a schedule of all the projects and plans which must be undertaken in the coming months and years to reduce the emissions generated by the council in order to achieve the 2030 target.</p>
<p>This work plan is also aligned to the Council Vision 2022-2026 which has a key aim of &lsquo;supporting the environment&rsquo;, improving sustainability, biodiversity and protecting habitats.</p>
<h4>Emission Baselines</h4>
<p>The council commissioned a carbon audit to calculate its carbon emissions and to set baselines. The audit used data from the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21.</p>
<p>This allowed for comparison of emissions pre-pandemic and during the restrictions to assess any incomplete or missing data from either year. The carbon emissions were categorised as Scope 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.</p>

<p>The Carbon Neutral Strategy identified three priority areas that will be addressed to ensure that there are reductions across all scopes.</p>
<p>Priority 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supply chain</p>
<p>Priority 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy</p>
<p>Priority 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other emitters</p>
<p>The largest single emitter was the council&rsquo;s supply chain (90.25% of total emissions), therefore working closely with suppliers and contractors will be essential in ensuring that the 2030 target is reached.</p>
<p>It will also be important to reduce energy demands and usage in all corporate buildings, reduce non-electric vehicle usage and car mileage. This is in addition to increasing the amount of renewable energy generated and ensuring that biodiversity within the district is enhanced and protected.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the diagram below (Figure 1), emissions generated from the council&rsquo;s housing stock and the waste produced by residents and businesses were excluded from the core carbon footprint of the council.</p>
<p>This was due to these emissions not being within the direct control of the council. It should be noted that improving the fabric of council housing stock and the efficiency of heating and lighting systems are included in this Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan.</p>

<h3>Arun District Council 2021-2022 emissions</h3>
<p>The council has finalised the carbon emissions for all scopes for the 2021-2022 financial year and included them within the table below.</p>
<p>This also showcases the tonnes of CO2e percentage change seen within Scopes 1, 2, 3 and the total emissions the council produces. All Scopes have seen a reduction and therefore the council has reduced its total emissions by 2.21%, falling from 27,774 tCO2e in the baseline year to 27,162 tCO2e in 2021-2022. For a full set of raw data please refer to Appendix C at the end of this report.</p>

<h3>Business as usual</h3>
<p>Figure 2 (below) indicates how the council&rsquo;s emissions will change if a business-as-usual approach is adopted, with only a 3.5% year-on-year reduction included to show the impact of the predicted decarbonation. As can be seen from the emission levels a significant amount of additional work is required for the council to reach its 2030 target. If results continue to follow the 2021-2022 trend the council will not achieve the 2030 carbon neutral target, therefore more radical measures will be needed to be put in place to ensure this target is achievable.</p>

<h3>Carbon reduction to 2030 taking the actions identified in the work plan</h3>
<p>The graph below (Figure 3) shows a course which will allow the council to reach its 2030 target, also taking into consideration predicted offsetting figures provided by tree planting and current renewable electricity generation via the solar panels (PV) installed on the Civic Centre. As expected, there will need to be reductions across all three scopes with a significant focus on Scope 3, as this makes up the majority of the council&rsquo;s total emissions. Figure 3 reflects the 2020-2021 baseline year, allowing for targets to be set from 2022-2023 onwards.</p>

<p>Fig 3. Graphic showing that by reducing emissions from all 3 Scopes the council will reach its 2030 target</p>
<p>Figure 4 indicates projected emission reductions over the next few years. These will be achieved by increasing year-on-year reductions in emissions associated with the council&rsquo;s supply chain, transitioning all council owned vehicles to electric vehicles (EV) in 2023, where possible, and limiting the emissions associated with business travel, employee commute, water/waste usage and fuel/ energy usage outside of Scope 1 and 2. The council will also be working closely with Freedom Leisure which is actively addressing its energy consumption and emissions.</p>

<p>This Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan is a document that will record the progress of projects that have been identified and evolve to incorporate innovation in the field of carbon reduction and management. This document highlights the work that the council will need to do and the challenges it will need to overcome. The Climate Action and Biodiversity Work Plan will also help the council identify priorities to reduce emissions and help support us to develop policies to reduce emissions across the district.</p>
<p>The council is committed to achieving its 2030 target and this document is designed to help plan projects and monitor the results. However, there are limitations to what we can achieve on our own and we will need to help others work towards carbon neutral goals of their own.</p>

<p>The council has developed a 10-year tree planting strategy, which aims to plant roughly 30,000 whips and 500 standard saplings on council owned land in the next 10 years. The first year of this has now been completed, resulting in 78 trees and 1500 whips being planted in 16 locations.</p>
<p>These trees will not only provide offsetting opportunities but will also help protect, improve, and maintain biodiversity within the district by providing habitats for many species.</p>
<p>Adopted by the Environment Committee on 17 November 2021.</p>
<p>Work is going on for the 2022/2023 tree planting season and an event was held in December 2022. Our 6 Green Flag Award winning parks and a number of other key- indicator sites have also been surveyed by an ecologist to help inform future maintenance and management plans. This will continue in future years to access how our plantings have impacted biodiversity.</p>

<p>The council has completed its work to produce a street trading policy which has restricted the selling or provision of single use plastic bottles, corrosive products and plastic bags which are not compostable. There is also specific consideration around the impacts of the proposed operation onto the local environment and includes consideration around carbon footprints, food mileage, waste disposal and waste generation. Those suppliers who can demonstrate that they are driving down their carbon footprint and operating in an environmentally friendly manner will be viewed favourably.</p>
<p>This important policy will therefore help reduce packaging and restrict the provision of plastic goods and other goods which have an adverse environmental impact</p>

<p>As per the results of the 2021-2022 carbon audit 91.20% (24.771tCO2e) of the council&rsquo;s emissions lie within the supply chain. This is the vast majority of all emissions. The council will review and rewrite the procurement policy to ensure that suppliers, contractors and businesses we work with are actively reducing their emissions and supporting the environment. This will be extremely complex and numerous angles will need to be reviewed, however this could look like favouring contractors who are able to provide a carbon neutral service, use EV&rsquo;s to provide goods or have other sustainable policies implemented within their activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, to ensure the local economy and local businesses are supported there will also be a focus on local contractors/suppliers.</p>
<p>The council aims to make this a requirement across all its procurement channels to include all contractor types. There is work being done internally and with Arun&rsquo;s procurement provider to ensure all legal aspects are covered. We</p>
<p>are also working with other councils (including town, parish, district and boroughs) across West Sussex to ensure a joined-up approach.</p>

<p>The council has applied for the second wave of the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund.</p>
<p>A bid for funding for the first programme of work has been made. If funding is awarded this will allow the council to upgrade up to 400 properties to an EPC rating of C. For this initial phase a fabric first approach will be taken with focus on improvements to insulation. By improving the energy efficiency of each home and taking a fabric first approach we will ensure that emissions are reduced and confirm levels are increased for our tenants, some of whom are the most vulnerable within the district. Additionally, there will be a reduction in carbon emissions released through heating and lighting each of these properties, helping reducing the council&rsquo;s impact on the environment. Where needed PV will also be installed to help boost the EPC rating to at least C.</p>
<p>To help this process a decarbonisation project board has been developed which meet regularly to monitor this progress.</p>
