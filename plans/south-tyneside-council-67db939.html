      <div>
        <h3>Foreword</h3>
        <p>South Tyneside Council is committed towards a sustainable future, striving towards carbon neutrality across
          Council buildings and operations by 2030.</p>
        <p>We stand at a critical juncture in our actions towards climate change, by the end of the coming decade we
          will be on one of two paths.</p>
        <p>A path in which we have past the point of no return, risking the health and safety of everyone on this
          planet, or a path of resolve with sustainable solutions that limit global temperatures beyond 1.5&deg;C by the
          end of the century.</p>
        <p>The signs are unmissable with the impacts of global warming being more severe than previously understood:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sea level rises are accelerating</li>
          <li>Oceans are warming</li>
          <li>Ecosystems are becoming more vulnerable</li>
          <li>Ice caps are melting</li>
          <li>Extreme weather events are increasing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To limit the global temperature rise to the necessary 1.5&deg;C by the end of the century will require a
          reduction in emissions of 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.</p>
        <p>According to the latest Emissions Gap Report from the UN Environment Programme, greenhouse gas emissions have
          risen 1.5% a year over the last decade.</p>
        <p>At current trends, we are looking at global warming of between 3.4&deg;C and 3.9&deg;C by the end of the
          century.</p>
        <p>The impact of all life on the planet, including ours will be catastrophic.</p>
        <p>However, with rapid global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, we can still reduce the impact of global
          temperature rises.</p>

        <p>South Tyneside Council&rsquo;s commitment towards climate change is strong and focused; implementing
          strategies that bring about real change, significantly reducing the amount of carbon being emitted, while
          increasing our renewable capabilities moving to a cleaner, greener renewable source for our energy supplies.
        </p>
        <p>We have already taken actions to reduce Council emissions through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A significant building rationalisation programme</li>
          <li>Installation of Solar PV to Council buildings</li>
          <li>LED lighting upgrades</li>
          <li>Building modernisation and retrofit improvements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some of our future plans include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Viking Energy Network in Jarrow, which will use a cutting-edge river source heat pump to heat Council
            buildings, while providing electricity from a solar PV farm</li>
          <li>Renewable electricity generation at the Council&rsquo;s Middlefields Depot, which includes a wind turbine,
            solar PV coupled with battery storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Climate change is a responsibility that we all must share without full engagement we will be unable to
          deliver the reductions required.</p>
        <p>We must open our eyes to the imminent threat facing us all, there is no time and no reason to delay.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Climate change is the defining issue of our time.</p>
        <p>The state of the climate and the health of our planet are closely linked, with changes in one radically
          affecting the other.</p>
        <p>The planet&rsquo;s average surface temperature has risen around 1&deg;C above pre-industrial levels.</p>
        <p>Global warming occurs through the increased levels of &lsquo;greenhouse gases&rsquo; building up in the
          atmosphere, which prevents heat escaping from the earth. This intensifies the so called &lsquo;greenhouse
          effect&rsquo; causing global temperatures to rise, resulting in climate change and instability.</p>

        <aside>
          <p>The science is unequivocal. The need for urgent action is unprecedented.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lands are being damaged</li>
            <li>Forests are being destroyed</li>
            <li>Ecosystems and biodiversity are being lost</li>
            <li>Oceans are rising</li>
            <li>Recurrent climate disasters are becoming global and borderless, resulting in unprecedented human and
              economic costs</li>
          </ul>
        </aside>

        <p>The world is at risk of crossing a point of no return on climate change. As we move into uncharted territory,
          we face disastrous consequences. We must take immediate action to address the significance of our climatic
          changes.</p>
        <p>The action required is significant but not insurmountable, but we must act now. The only solution is rapid,
          ambitious, transformative action by all - Governments, regions, businesses and society must work together
          towards a common climate goal.</p>
        <p>It is not too late to change course, but every day that passes means that the world heats up a little more
          and the cost of inaction mounts. Achieving a sustainable future is not the job of one person; we are all in
          this together.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Understanding climate change</h3>

        <h4>Causes of climate change</h4>
        <p>Greenhouses gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), trap heat in the atmosphere stopping it escaping
          into space. These gases exist naturally through volcanic activity, changes in solar activity, or natural
          sources of CO<sub>2</sub>. However, scientists have been able to rule out natural events as the cause and
          speed to which climate change is taking place. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy (coal,
          oil, and natural gas) and the clearing of forests, is having a direct impact, increasing global temperatures
          significantly, altering our planet&rsquo;s climate, resulting in more extreme and unpredictable weather
          events.</p>

        <h4>Impacts of climate change</h4>
        <p>Greenhouse gases act like a blanket, the thicker the blanket, the warmer our planet becomes. At the same
          time, the Earth&rsquo;s oceans also absorb some of this extra carbon dioxide, making them more acidic and less
          hospitable for sea life. Humans, animals and eco-systems face new challenges for survival due to the effects
          of climate change.</p>
        <p>More frequent and intense droughts, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming
          oceans will have a direct impact on the places we live, impacting on livelihoods and communities.</p>
        <p>As climate change worsens, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent or severe, with people across
          cities and towns now facing the consequences.</p>

        <h4>Adapting to climate change</h4>
        <p>To avoid the worst effects of climate change, we need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. We must
          prepare for the significant and unavoidable consequences of climate change through increasing temperatures,
          shifting precipitation patterns, ocean acidification and the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme
          weather events.</p>
      </div>


      <!-- POLICY CONTEXT SECTION-->

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/img-policy-context.jpg" alt="A new energy efficent nissan car" />
      </figure>

      <div>

        <h3>Policy context</h3>

        <h4>International context</h4>
        <p>In December 2015 the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) was held in Paris. The conference
          marked a significant milestone bringing countries together to address the impacts of climate change.</p>
        <p>The Paris Agreement was established with a central aim to keep global temperature rises this century well
          below 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further
          to 1.5&deg;C.</p>
        <p>In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report on the impacts
          of global warming at 1.5&deg;C.</p>
        <p>The report clearly highlighted that limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C would require &ldquo;rapid, far reaching
          and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society&rdquo;.</p>

        <h4>National context</h4>
        <p>The UK Climate Change Act sets a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions against 1990 levels to net zero by
          2050.</p>
        <p>The UK&rsquo;s 2050 net zero target is one of the most ambitious in the world and was recommended by the
          Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the UK&rsquo;s independent climate advisory body.</p>
        <p>The Climate Change Act requires the Government to set legally-binding &lsquo;carbon budgets&rsquo; to act as
          stepping stones towards the 2050 target.</p>

        <h4>Local context</h4>
        <p>Meeting challenging reduction targets of net zero by 2050 cannot be achieved by the Government on its own.
        </p>
        <p>As a Local Authority we must commit to playing a leadership role, guiding at a local level pursuing and
          implementing actions that bring about change, supporting reductions in emissions.</p>
        <p>The Regional Low Carbon Strategy (RLCS) commissioned by NECA Economic Directors (Green Economy Working Group)
          provides advice on low carbon project themes. The Strategy demonstrates a cohesive regional approach and
          contributes to wider regional economic development.</p>

        <aside>
          <p>The Low Carbon Strategy identifies 5 key themes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Planning policy for a low carbon future</li>
            <li>Domestic Energy</li>
            <li>Advance propulsion (Electric and Ultra Low Emission Vehicles)</li>
            <li>Infrastructure intelligence</li>
            <li>Large scale & community low carbon energy</li>
          </ul>
        </aside>

        <p>The RLCS also aligns closely to that of the North East Local Economic Partnership (NELEP) Energy for Growth
          Strategy.</p>
        <p>Government figures show that in South Tyneside during 2005 to 2017, carbon emissions have fallen by 37%,
          across three sectors, domestic, transport and commercial/industrial. Per capita this represents a fall from
          5.6 tonnes in 2005 to 3.5 tonnes in 2017.</p>

      <div>

        <h3>Development of the Strategy and Action Plan</h3>
        <p>The UK&rsquo;s climate is changing. To limit the most damaging impacts, we must all work together. As a
          community leader we must encourage and facilitate behaviour change not only across Council buildings and
          services, but across the wider community, adopting a collective approach that supports reductions in emission,
          while adapting to the inevitable impacts of climate change.</p>
        <p>The Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan covers two key aspects:</p>
        <p>Climate Change Mitigation: focusing on the actions we need to take to reduce our carbon emissions, helping to
          mitigate against further global temperature rises; and</p>
        <p>Climate Change Adaptation: establishing the necessary steps that we must take to prepare and adapt to future
          changes in our climate</p>
        <p>The Strategy brings a wide range of plans and strategic actions across the Council into one place, through
          the establishment of a 5 year action plan focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation requirements.</p>

        <aside>
          <p>The purpose of the Strategy is to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a coordinated approach towards climate change mitigation and adaptation requirements across the
              Council</li>
            <li>Support reductions in carbon emissions across Council activities</li>
            <li>To support the development of a low carbon, sustainable and resilient Borough</li>
            <li>Ensure a diverse and natural environment</li>
            <li>Champion and influence positive behaviour changes, raising awareness on the climate change challenges
              being faced</li>
          </ul>
        </aside>

        <h4>Data analysis and research</h4>
        <p>Through research, data collection and monitoring we must understand the issues we face and the actions we
          must take to address the impacts of climate change. The following areas of research were undertaken to help
          inform the Strategy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Policy and legal drivers for mitigating against and adapting to climate change</li>
          <li>Working with Council colleagues and key stakeholders, identifying actions already underway, and the
            impacts being delivered</li>
          <li>Identifying future delivery opportunities that will support on-going reductions</li>
          <li>Identifying baseline carbon emission levels</li>
          <li>Researching measures to support reductions in the Council&rsquo;s carbon footprint, working towards carbon
            neutrality by 2030</li>
          <li>Increasing the knowledge and understanding of the impacts of climate change, looking at past trends and
            future projections across the Borough</li>
          <li>Prioritising areas for action, implementing measures to support carbon reductions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Public consultation and engagement</h3>

        <p>Awareness-raising and public engagement has been a key aspect in the development of the Council&rsquo;s
          Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. Through effective engagement we have provided the opportunity for
          members of the public and key stakeholders to have their say in relation to climate change.</p>

        <p>The Council understands that it will be able to achieve far more by working in partnership with communities,
          organisations, businesses and individuals.</p>

        <p>Consultation activities have helped to provide a better understanding of stakeholders&rsquo; values,
          interests, issues, and concerns, in relation to climate change, while supporting the generation of new ideas.

        <h3>Our commitment</h3>

        <p>This Strategy and Action Plan is driven by our climate change objective, in which we strive to become carbon
          neutral, while ensuring we play our part in meeting wider National and International targets.</p>
        <p>The 21st Century will see a critical turning point in the relationship between the global economy, society
          and the natural environment.</p>
        <p>To meet climate change challenges now and in the future we must develop and implement new models of low
          carbon growth and climate resilience.</p>
        <p>To be successful we will need to drive investment and innovation, identifying solutions to address the
          challenges we face.</p>
        <p>In 2019, the Government amended the UK&rsquo;s emission reduction target, to &ldquo;net zero&rdquo; greenhouse gases by
          2050, demonstrating a strong commitment towards the fight against climate change. South Tyneside Council has
          made a pledge to take all necessary steps to become &ldquo;carbon neutral by 2030&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>As we embark on this journey we must acknowledge that this will be challenging, with the need for significant
          change and investment, which will require a collective approach, with everyone playing their part.</p>
        <p>We must call upon the Government to provide the necessary powers and financial support if we are to
          successfully achieve both National and our own carbon reduction targets, working towards limiting global
          warming to less than 1.5&deg;C.</p>
        <p>It is equally important that we embrace the opportunities available in the low carbon and green industry,
          supporting our drive and ambition towards:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Economic growth</li>
          <li>Job creation</li>
          <li>Skills and training</li>
          <li>Ensuring the health and wellbeing of our residents</li>
          <li>A safe and sustainable future for all</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The transition to a cleaner, greener, low carbon future will require all employees, partners, businesses and
          residents to support and adopt new lifestyles and operations.</p>
        <p>This Strategy marks South Tyneside Council&rsquo;s commitment towards climate change, providing a platform
          for collective actions and a shared vision for a successful and vibrant future supported by a prosperous and
          flourishing natural environment.</p>
        <p>(Carbon neutrality, or having a net zero carbon footprint, refers to achieving net zero carbon dioxide
          emissions by balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal from improvement activities, where this cannot be
          achieved emissions may then be removed through carbon offsetting)</p>

        <h3>South Tyneside Council&rsquo;s &ldquo;Climate Emergency&rdquo; pledge</h3>

        <p>Councils around the world are responding by declaring a &ldquo;Climate Emergency&rdquo;. South Tyneside
          Council recognises its role as part of this global community of Council&rsquo;s to limit the impact of climate
          change by being proactive locally and demanding action from Government. To support this delivery we:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Declare a &ldquo;Climate Emergency&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Take all necessary steps to make South Tyneside Council carbon neutral by 2030.</li>
          <li>Lead by example by establishing South Tyneside Council as a champion for a carbon neutral future for the
            Borough. This will include using the Council&rsquo;s advocacy role to influence actions across all our
            communities and across the region that promotes carbon reduction.</li>
          <li>Call on the Leader and Chief Executive to write to the Government to pass the necessary legislation and
            provide the powers and resources necessary to deliver our climate change goals.</li>
          <li>Produce a comprehensive Climate Change Strategy that will set clear and unambiguous targets for carbon
            reduction, including interim targets. This will be the product of consultation with key stakeholders
            including the voluntary and community sector and will be considered by Council by 31 March 2020. This will
            include an Action Plan for the next five years.</li>
          <li>Prepare a report for Full Council on at least an annual basis setting out performance against agreed
            targets and recommending any amendments to the published Action Plan.
          <li>Convene a &ldquo;Climate Emergency&rdquo; summit in 2020 to raise awareness of the impacts of climate change, provide
            expert support and advice and seek commitments from partners and stakeholders.</li>
          <li>Ensure that all Council strategic decisions, policies and strategies are in line with the shift towards
            carbon neutral by 2030.</li>

      <!--SOUTH TYNESIDE COUNCILS CARBON EMISSION POSITION SECTION-->

      <div>

        <h3>South Tyneside Council&rsquo;s carbon emission position</h3>

        <p>Reducing the amount of carbon we emit is essential if we are to keep global temperature rises below the IPCCs
          recommended 1.5&deg;C</p>

        <p>South Tyneside Council has actively been involved in delivering solutions that support the reduction in
          consumption and emissions, through various schemes, including a significant property rationalisation
          programme; LED upgrades to street lighting, along with various building improvement programmes.</p>

        <p>South Tyneside Council has been required to report its carbon emission for a number of years through the
          Governments Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) mandatory emissions scheme. This scheme no longer operates
          (final emission reporting year was 2018/19).</p>

        <p>Under this scheme we demonstrated significant reductions. In 2014/15 we reported 21,217 tonnes of
          CO<sub>2</sub>, in 2018/19 the final reporting year of the scheme we reported 10,793 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>,
          a 49% reduction.</p>

        <p>However, we are unable to use this as the baseline reporting position as it excludes a number of key areas,
          such as fleet and schools.</p>

        <p>Due to the incomplete data, we have established a more accurate data set, establishing 2018/19 as the new
          baseline year, for all future reporting to be measured against.</p>

        <p>Areas of exclusion under the new reporting year includes: </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Schools that are not managed or operated by South Tyneside Council (i.e. Academies, PFIs, Trusts and
            Voluntary Aided Schools)</li>
          <li>Tenanted Factory Units</li>
          <li>Social Housing Stock</li>
          <li>Short-term hired vehicles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council&rsquo;s baseline start point for 2018/19 is 19,010 tonnes of Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

        <p>This is the figure, in which all future actions and improvements will be measured and reported against.</p>

        <p>The Council&rsquo;s aspirational target of carbon neutrality by 2030 will be extremely challenging. To
          achieve this target the Council has set interim reduction targets of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>25% reduction within 3 years (March 2023)</li>
          <li>50% reduction within 5 years (March 2025)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council will undertake a detailed review of emission reductions as part of the monitoring and review
          process, providing an annual update in terms of delivery against targets.</p>

        <p>Reduction targets set are dependent on successful delivery of innovative projects identified, along with
          capital investment into current and future carbon reduction schemes. Changes in scheme delivery and capital
          investments will have a direct impact on successful delivery of the figures identified.</p>

        <p>South Tyneside Council understands its position well in relation to a clear emission reduction programme.</p>

        <p>Our sustainable ambitions must shape the strategic decisions being made, embedding a culture of &ldquo;climate
          first&rdquo; across all Council activities.</p>

        <p>The Climate Change Strategy provides a framework for South Tyneside Council, detailing the necessary steps
          and actions that must be taken to drive and deliver change, reducing emissions from our buildings, operations
          and those services we provide.</p>

        <p>The Strategy commits to a wide-range of actions, including areas that will investigate and implement, where
          feasible new and sustainable sources of onsite energy generation and supply.</p>

        <p>The actions identified have been established through the analysis of consumption and emission
          data,identifying key areas which contribute most to the Council&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>

        <p>In addition, Members and Officers workshops were undertaken to ensure full engagement, providing additional
          focus on the key areas that will bring about the most change in terms of emission reductions.</p>

        <p>The Strategy and supporting five year Action Plan sets-out the Council&rsquo;s objectives across 11 key

        <h3>Theme 1 - Reducing emissions from Council buildings</h3>

        <p>The Council has actively implemented direct improvement measures across its building stock resulting in
          significant reductions in carbon emissions, while increasing on-site energy generation improving the
          sustainability of our buildings.</p>

        <p>A significant building rationalisation programme has seen old and inefficient buildings replaced with
          centralised hubs installed with improved LED lighting, building management systems, in addition to renewable
          and energy efficient technologies.</p>

        <h3>Theme 2 - Street lighting</h3>

        <p>Public street lighting is an essential element of an urban environment. It affects residents&rsquo; sense of
          safety and social inclusion. It provides visibility for motorists, helps to reduce crime, while creating an
          inviting environment after dark.</p>

        <p>Street lighting is undeniably important, but in a time of environmental awareness and budget cuts, we need to
          look at innovative lighting solutions to help reduce our costs and emissions, while keeping abreast of new
          street lighting innovations.</p>

        <p>Operating street lights across South Tyneside accounts for a significant proportion of the Council&rsquo;s
          electricity budget and reported carbon emissions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="side-by-side">

        <div>
          <h5>Progress to date</h5>

          <p>Street lighting is a key priority of the Council with significant improvements already taking place,
            through the replacement of existing sodium street lights to light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Between 2015-2019 we have upgraded 27% of street lights to LEDs</li>
            <li>We have removed 1765 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> through Street light LED upgrades</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Future plans</h4>

          <p>Street lights will continue to play a fundamental role in the on-going development of smart towns and
            cities. Future actions will include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>A phased capital investment programme with continued focus on upgrading old and inefficient street
              lights to LEDs</li>
            <li>Investigation of innovative solutions removing reliance on grid electricity supply to street lights
              replacing with a renewable or carbon neutral source of supply</li>
            <li>Investigate future street lighting technologies to support a SMART Grid development across South
              Tyneside</li>

        <h3>Theme 3 - Transportation and Staff Travel</h3>

        <p>South Tyneside Council understands that radical changes are required to the way we operate and deliver
          services to support emission reductions.</p>

        <p>This change will be brought about in multiple ways; the Council&rsquo;s Transport and Fleet Services are
          actively engaged in developing Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) options to support this transition.</p>

        <p>In addition, for staff who commute and use their own vehicles for business purposes we have already put in
          place a pool of electric vehicles for staff useat our main operational building, South Shields Town Hall,
          while encouraging sustainable modes for everyday travel.</p>

        <p>We are aware that much more needs to be undertaken to ensure that this transition is successful. Providing
          reliable alternatives to the private car for everyday journeys will be one of the simplest ways to reduce
          emissions. This will be assisted by the emerging Local Plan; Highways Asset Management Plan and Integrated
          Transport Strategy, which aims to improve the quality and quantity of infrastructure available to all.</p>

        <p>The Council will continue to drive improvements by:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reducing the need to travel</li>
          <li>Promote the use of public transport and active travel</li>
          <li>On-going installation of EV charge points at council sites</li>
          <li>Investigating, Implementing and Promoting sustainable transport</li>
          <li>Decarbonising fleet vehicles</li>
          <li>Ensuring that businesses that work/contract with the Council have green fleet and carbon neutral ambitions

        <h3>Theme 4 - Environment and biodiversity</h3>

        <p>Healthy ecosystems are fundamental to life on our planet; small changes in average temperatures can have a
          significant impact upon them.</p>

        <p>The climate emergency and biodiversity crisis we see today are inextricably linked. Nationally the impact of
          climate change has resulted in:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Catastrophic collapse of nature&rsquo;s ecosystems, with more than 40% of insect species declining and a
            third endangered</li>
          <li>Total mass of insects have fallen by 2.5% a year for the last 25-30 years</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Global warming is likely to be the greatest cause of species extinctions this century. The IPCC says a
          1.5&deg;C average rise may put 20-30% of species at risk of extinction. If the planet warms by more than
          2&deg;C, most ecosystems will struggle.</p>

        <p>The natural environment will have to make its own adjustments in response to climate change. However,
          sustaining and optimising the benefits we receive from ecosystems will require some forms of human
          intervention.</p>

        <p>The revised National Planning Policy Framework along with the Council&rsquo;s emerging Local Plan places
          significant focus on the protection of our natural environment. As the Local Planning Authority we have set
          out strategic policies on the &lsquo;conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and historic
          environment, addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>

        <p>Parks, green spaces and allotments will all have a significant role to play in helping to address the
          Council&rsquo;s response to the climate change emergency.</p>

        <p>Trees will also play a significant role in our fight against climate change at present South Tyneside tree
          canopy coverage is approximately 10%, with a clear commitment to increase this further.</p>

        <p>There may be no greater threat facing our younger generation than climate change. This mounting global crisis
          will bear the greatest burden on the young of today and the future. As temperatures increase, and extreme
          weather events expand our children&rsquo;s lives and futures will be the most disrupted.</p>

        <p>We have the opportunity to tackle this crisis before it is too late. Decisive and immediate action must be
          taken to cut emissions. We must educate children to adapt to the immediate challenges faced in relation to
          climate change - effectively educating today&rsquo;s children so they fully understand their role in the
          future.</p>

        <p>We must listen to the voices of children and young people, who will inherit the significant challenges faced
          in relation to a changing climate.</p>

        <p>Schools lie at the heart of our community providing a fundamental gateway in the education of our children.
        </p>

        <p>Our children&rsquo;s role, now and in the future cannot be underestimated, we must embrace their learning
          environment, educating them effectively so they will have the skills and knowledge base to adapt and drive
          on-going improvements, towards a low-carbon and sustainable future.</p>

        <h3>Theme 6 - South Tyneside Homes operations</h3>

        <p>South Tyneside Homes (STH) is an arms-length management organisation (ALMO) created by South Tyneside Council
          in April 2006 to manage, maintain and improve its 18,000 Council homes and estates. Extensive improvement
          programmes have been delivered during this time resulting in sustainable homes that meet increasing levels of
          need, while reducing inequalities and tackling fuel poverty, improving wellbeing across all stages of
          people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

        <p>In addition to the significant improvements to social housing, considerable efforts have been made to improve
          the energy efficiency of buildings directly controlled by STH, including Operational Buildings, Housing Plus
          Schemes, High Rises and Common Rooms.</p>

        <p>Low carbon and renewable solutions have been installed across a number of STH&rsquo;s buildings, including
          the installation of solar PV along with LED lighting upgrades.</p>

        <p>The implementation of a diverse range of energy efficiency measures and improvement works has resulted in
          significant and recognisable benefits, clearly supporting reductions in energy usage and cost, while
          supporting on-going reductions in carbon emissions.</p>

        <p>(Emissions from Social Housing are not included within this strategy and action plan. Energy usage that
          contributes to carbon emissions from Social Housing are outside the control of the Council and are therefore
          excluded from monitoring and reporting activities. However, we will lead by example, providing an advocacy
          role to support and influence actions that promote carbon reductions across our communities).</p>

          with many Local Authorities declaring climate change emergencies.</p>

        <p>The Council procures a significant amount of goods and services every year, it is therefore imperative that
          we utilise the procurement process effectively to help address the impacts of climate change.</p>

        <p>In our role as community leader we have direct connections with businesses and service providers, community
          groups and households by virtue of the services we provide.</p>

        <p>We must embrace this opportunity effectively integrating the consideration of carbon emission reductions
          across procurement activities.</p>

        <p>Developing robust and practical approaches in procurement specifications and evaluation processes can help
          address this, increasing the degree in which we can effectively influence emission reductions, while
          increasing sustainable processes across our buildings and services.</p>

        <p>The Council is committed to minimising the environmental impacts of goods, services and work that it
          procures, ensuring that procurement activities are completed in an environmentally friendly and sustainable
          way.</p>

        <p>The Council has already implemented a number of improvement measures across procurement activities by:<p>

            <ul>
              <li>Ensuring the Council&rsquo;s Corporate Procurement Strategy guidelines refers all procurement
                proposals to the Climate Change Lead to review and ensure consideration is given to the integration of
                environmental approaches, supporting sustainability and carbon emission reductions in the procurement of
                goods and services</li>
              <li>Including a specific section within the procurement contracting template focused specifically on
                sustainability and community benefit considerations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Council will continue to implement innovative approaches that support the reduction off carbon
              emissions by:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Improving procurement specifications to increase sustainability across the supply chain, encouraging
                suppliers and contractors to offer and provide sustainable products and services to help improve
                environmental performance</li>
              <li>Taking all necessary steps to ensure that goods and services are procured from sustainable sources
                minimising environmental impacts from the products and services procured</li>
              <li>Implementing principles of waste minimisation, recycling and re-use</li>
              <li>Maximising social benefits, through community benefit clauses in contracts where appropriate to
                improve the local environment</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Theme 8 - Policy</h3>

        <p>Radical changes are needed to address climate change. We are facing two unprecedented challenges:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We must dramatically reduce our carbon emissions</li>
          <li>We need to prepare for unavoidable environmental impacts by building climate resilience into our systems
            and services</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Local Authorities directly emit only a small percentage of UK&rsquo;s carbon emissions. However, the power to
          influence uniquely places the Council at the heart of place-shaping work.</p>

        <p>We can effectively use our position to bring together leadership and direction, developing a framework with
          clear ambition supporting the drive towards carbon neutrality across future developments.</p>

        <p>The decisions that we make now and in the future will play a vital role in protecting local populations,
          local authority services, infrastructure and finances, while securing new local economic opportunities. To
          make a real difference we will need planning powers and easier access to Government funding, to truly mitigate
          and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>

        <p>Tackling the causes of climate change, and preparing for its impacts, touches on all aspects of society, for
          these reasons we need strong and effective policies sitting at the heart of our decision making processes. It
          is essential that policies are clear and robust, focused on drastically reducing carbon emissions across the
          Council&rsquo;s buildings and operations, while ensuring we effectively build climate resilience into our
          systems and services.</p>

        <p>The decisions we make must:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Promote activity on climate change, demonstrating leadership at local and national levels</li>
          <li>Promote low carbon design approaches to reduce energy consumption in new and existing buildings, ensuring
            future developments are designed to avoid risks through suitable and sustainable adaptation measures
            providing sufficient resilience</li>
          <li>Raise the profile and implementation of carbon reduction and adaptations across Council buildings</li>
          <li>Vigorously promote small and large scale renewable energy projects</li>
          <li>Develop and embed good practice, undertaking initiatives that support joint working opportunities, while
            sharing experience, skills and ideas to support the reduction in emissions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Theme 9 - Adaptation</h3>

        <p>The world&rsquo;s climate is changing, even if all emissions ceased today, the climate would still continue
          to change as a result of historic emissions.</p>

        <p>UK Climate Projection Met Office 2018 headline results set out a range of possible outcomes over the next
          century based on different rates of GHG emissions into the atmosphere. The high emission scenario (closely
          matches to the current global emissions trajectory) shows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Summer temperatures could be up to 5.4&deg;C hotter by 2070</li>
          <li>Winters could be up to 4.2&deg;C warmer</li>
          <li>The chance of a summer as hot as 2018 is around 50% by 2050</li>
          <li>Average summer rainfall could decrease by up to 47% by 2070, while there could be up to 35% more
            precipitation in winter</li>
          <li>Sea levels are projected to rise over the 21st century under all emission scenarios</li>
        </ul>

        <p>England&rsquo;s legislative adaptation, and mitigation, framework is primarily set out in the Climate Change
          Act 2008. The Act places legal requirements on the UK Government to assess and report climate change risks;
          along with implementing a national programme of adaptations.</p>

        <p>Local authorities have a significant role to play. Climate change adaptation plays a major part in the
          Council&rsquo;s existing and emerging local plan. Effective measures such as the implementation of sustainable
          drainage systems play a key role in adapting to a changing climate, by helping to minimise the impacts of
          flash flooding events, while coupling as an ecological network supporting biodiversity and the on-going
          development of the natural environment.</p>

        <p>It is important that the Council implements adaptation actions across a range of key areas, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Buildings and services</li>
          <li>Corporate plans, policies and performance</li>
          <li>Natural capital assets (e.g. soil, air, water)</li>
          <li>Infrastructure</li>
          <li>Land use, planning and the built environment</li>

        <h3>Theme 10 - Cultural change and awareness</h3>

        <p>Education and awareness is an essential element in our response towards climate change. It helps us
          understand and address the impact of global warming, while encouraging changes in attitudes and behaviours
          across the Council.</p>

        <p>Raising awareness on climate change will help inform decision-making, while supporting the essential
          development of robust processes, policies and procedures focused clearly on mitigating and adapting to the
          impacts of climate change.</p>

        <p>Building a wider understanding on the impacts of climate change is widely seen as a critical foundation for
          change and one, which we must all embrace.</p>

        <p>It is the role of everyone across the Council to play their part, supporting the Council in achieving their
          climate change goal of carbon neutrality by 2030.</p>

        <h3>Theme 11 - Championing a carbon neutral future</h3>

        <p>Millions of people throughout the world, especially young people are calling on leaders to do more to address
          the climate emergency we face.</p>

        <p>Choosing the path towards change is not the job of one person, one Council, one Government, we are all in
          this together. If we want to change, we must be that change.</p>

        <p>As a local leader we have an important role to play, when addressing the impacts of climate change. We must
          demonstrate strong local leadership, forging partnerships, while mobilising communities, businesses and
          society to help address the impacts of climate change.</p>

        <p>We must call upon the Government to increase the powers of Local Authorities through clear national policies
          on climate change, providing the necessary resources to be able to deliver them effectively. We must ensure
          public participation, consulting local people on proposed projects that support reductions in our emissions.
          By working together we can turn good ideas into tangible results, tackling the impacts of climate change in a
          joined up and strategic way.</p>

        <p>We understand that South Tyneside Council has an important leadership role in creating a low carbon, climate
          resilient future.</p>

        <p>We will strive towards achieving this by:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Ensuring transparency and accountability towards the Council&rsquo;s goals and actions, providing progress
            against our set targets</li>
          <li>Representing and advocating for change at National, Regional and Local levels</li>
          <li>Representing local concern and viewpoints in relation to climate change</li>
          <li>Communicating, engaging and listening to our community</li>
          <li>Work across different sectors to facilitate and encourage co-ordinated action</li>
          <li>Providing vision and direction to local groups, building support for that vision</li>
          <li>Identify and advocate opportunities that support wider community activities in relation to addressing the
            impacts of climate change and emission reductions</li>
          <li>Encouraging and empowering residents and businesses to participate and act in the fight towards climate
            change</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p>We must think local and act global, the fight against climate change must be fought by everyone or it
            cannot be fought at all.</p>

        <h3>Governance</h3>
        <p>The scale of the climate change challenge we face is unprecedented. This is a challenge like no other, one in
          which the totality of the solutions needed may prove to be impossible.</p>
        <p>To meet the ambitious targets of the Council&rsquo;s climate change emergency motion will require focus,
          ambition and a willingness to change at every level.</p>
        <p>This Strategy and Action Plan brings together the strategic activities required to reduce carbon emissions
          across the Council.</p>
        <p>The delivery objectives have been structured based on key themed areas. Each theme has a summary of actions
          established, which are found within the action plan.</p>
        <p>The Climate Change Action Plan provides a detailed breakdown of the actions proposed that will help meet the
          delivery objectives within the key themed areas.</p>
        <p>To assess the overall impact of activities undertaken, it is essential that a robust governance structure is
          established to help monitor the effectiveness of the actions identified and being delivered, ensuring they are
          being effectively met.</p>

        <h4>Themed Delivery Objectives</h4>
        <p>The Strategy is organised around 11 key delivery themes, each with identified teams/stakeholders responsible
          for the delivery of the actions.</p>

        <h4>Officers Working Group</h4>
        <p>The Officers Working Group will provide a coordinated approach across the themed areas and the Council,
          monitoring and reporting on progress, while identifying any risks for further investigation.</p>

        <h4>Members Working Group</h4>
        <p>The Members Working Group will receive regular detailed updates on the key themed areas within the strategy,
          significant project development and awareness of best practice. This group will act as champions and help
          support and influence behavioural change across the Borough.</p>

        <h4>Place Select Committee</h4>
        <p>Progress against the strategy and action plan will be scrutinised by the Place Select Committee mid-year. The
          Committee will provide any relevant advice and recommendations to Cabinet in relation to the Strategy.</p>

        <h4>Cabinet</h4>
        <p>The Officers Working Group will provide six monthly updates to the Place Select Committee detailing progress
          against the strategy and action plan. A combined annual report will be provided to Cabinet for endorsement and
          recommendation to full Council with key recommendations requiring changes to the strategy or action plan.</p>

        <h4>Council</h4>
        <p>Council will receive the annual report, consider any implications and be asked to approve any required
          changes to the strategy and action plan.</p>

        <h3>Monitoring and reporting</h3>

        <p>The Council has made a pledge to take all necessary steps to make South Tyneside Council carbon neutral by
          2030.</p>

        <p>The Climate Change Strategy and supporting 5 year Action Plan, identifies key delivery themes, supported by
          tasks that will help deliver our ambitious target towards carbon neutrality.</p>

        <p>Our reduction targets will be measured against our carbon emissions in the baseline year of 2018/19. A
          monitoring and reporting framework will help the Council effectively monitor and report on progress being
          made, establishing a quarterly monitoring and reporting cycle, across each of the key delivery themes.</p>

        <p>The monitoring cycle will help capture our overall position on a regular basis, while identifying any
          potential risks early on so action can be taken.</p>

        <p>A detailed update report to full Council will be completed on an annual basis, setting out performance
          against agreed actions, while providing information on any changes required to ensure we are on target towards
          meeting our delivery objectives.</p>

        <p>An annual update will also be provided on the Council&rsquo;s website.</p>
