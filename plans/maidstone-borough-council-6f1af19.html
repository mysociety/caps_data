<h2>1 Transport</h2><p>Aim: To support the shift from cars to active and mass transport and enable the transformation from fossil fuels to no tailpipe emissions.</p><p>Transport creates the largest amount of emissions in the borough. It has a negative impact on air quality and health. The residents&rsquo; survey showed support for investing in active travel and providing more charging points for electric vehicles.</p><h3>1.1</h3><h4>Action</h4><p>Draft Local Plan to:</p><ul><li>Establish policies that enable the infrastructure required for low carbon vehicles</li><li>Ensure policies encourage and enable development proposals which give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and with its surrounding areas; and second to facilitating high quality public transport connectivity.</li></ul><h4>Output</h4><p>Emphasis is given to walking, cycling and public transport.</p><h4>Outcome</h4><p>Local Plan includes measures and actions that will help to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.</p><h4>Cost and Whom</h4><p>Strategic planning officer time.</p><h4>Timescale</h4><p>2020-22</p><h3>1.2</h3><h4>Action</h4><p>Work with KCC to develop Maidstone Integrated Transport Strategy, and Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan, as part of the Local Plan review to promote and support a modal shift to walking, cycling, public transport, and electric vehicles.</p><h4>Output</h4><p>Integrated Transport Strategy Developed.</p><h4>Outcome</h4><p>Increase in infrastructure supporting walking, cycling, buses and electric vehicles.</p><h4>Cost and Whom</h4><p>Transport and Development Team and Strategic Planning.</p><h4>Timescale</h4><p>2020-22</p><h3>1.3</h3><h4>Action</h4><p>Produce a business case for the introduction of a workplace parking levy to fund active travel or public transport.</p><h4>Output</h4><p>Organisations charged for providing car parking spaces may result in fewer spaces being provided. Funds would be raised.</p><h4>Outcome</h4><p>Fewer cars on road, greater use of sustainable transport modes and increased funding for sustainable infrastructure.</p><h4>Cost and Whom</h4><p>Biodiversity and Climate Change Officer (BDCC Officer) time, Strategic Planning staff time</p><h4>Timescale</h4><p>2024</p><h3>1.4</h3><h4>Action</h4><p>Develop a travel plan for council staff that sets out objectives and an action plan to encourage the shift to electric and ultra-low emission vehicles, more working from home, more sustainable travel patterns and an increase in the use of public transport and active transport modes through:</p><ul><li>parking management on council premises</li><li>discounted public transport fares</li><li>pool cars</li><li>audio and video conferencing</li><li>car-sharing</li><li>electric bikes</li><li>remote and home working</li><li>promoting fuel efficient driving techniques to all staff</li></ul><p>Update travel expenses policies generally and avoid any perverse incentives. Update before any moves to new premises. Include any learning from working practices that changed due to COVID-19.</p><h4>Output</h4><p>Plan developed, formally adopted, disseminated and included in induction for new staff. Staff are given information and support to reduce car use.</p><h4>Outcome</h4><p>Staff adopting more sustainable transport practices.</p><h4>Cost and Whom</h4><p>BDCC officer, Head of Human Resources, Head of Commissioning and Business Improvement, Transformation and Digital Services, and colleagues time.</p><h4>Timescale</h4><p>2021</p><h3>1.5</h3><h4>Action</h4><p>Develop policies and increase remote working to reduce travelling to work and office energy needs, without a reduction in outputs or access to services.
