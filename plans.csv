Still only a draft after 12 months; approved by the Cabinet in March 2020, but that means little (the whole council declared an emergency in March 2019).",,,"No, the papers for the Cabinet meeting (plus its two appendices) need to be processed via the council's PR dept in order to make make it glossy and appear impressive for public consumption.","Haringey has been publishing annual carbon reports for some years. The goal of reducing carbon emissions Borough-wide was quietly dropped and replaced by the far smaller goal of reducing emissions from council-owned buildings. Thus, any sale of council buildings would flatter their figures. The council claims that they will meet their goal—""40:20"" of several years ago—of achieving a 40% reduction in emissions by 2020. (if this is true, then it is true for council buildings only).","Haringey's ""action plan"" is admitted to be only a draft. It re-states the importance of the issue and talks at length about the council's ambition. It is three months overdue and comes 12 months after the council unanimously declared a Climate Emergency (in March 2019). There is no action in the plan. There will be no action before November 2020 at the earliest. In any event, it is moot as to whether the current Administration is capable of undertaking any action after then (i.e. after COP26).

Haringey did produce an impressive document setting out their ambitions, ""Going Green: Haringey’s Greenest Borough Strategy"". The difficulty is that this was published 11 (eleven) years ago: http://opinion8.ning.com/forum/topics/climate-change-and-haringey-council","No earlier than November 2020. Although the PR function is likely to produce publications saying how well the council is doing, it is unlikely Haringey will take meaningful action.",Briefing: Haringey Climate Change Action Plan,y,data/plans/london-borough-of-haringey-fd227a8.pdf,pdf,,HRY,LBO,211.0,LBO,England,E09000014,,London,266357.0,https://www.haringey.gov.uk/,,
